HollowHolla
===========

_Hollow Holla_ is a social networking mock-up framework.

Every once in a while, I have an idea for a project that would be nicely presented as if it were a social networking site, but not a real site.

So, I'm making one.

This application should be a viable stand-in for a user activity feed that could easily be any similar website.

More to come as development progresses.
